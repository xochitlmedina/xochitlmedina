Hello! I am Xochitl *(So-chee)* Medina! I am a Rising Fourth Year Geography and Environmental Studies double major at UC Santa Barbara. I created this website in a six week summer course on the subject of programming for GIS majors. This was not my first experience with computer science or GIS, but this class was my first experience with the two combined. I had worked with statistical data relating to geography in a MatLab-based class before, and learned an in-depth practical approach to GIS in an ArcGIS-based 3-class series. After having taken these five classes related specifically to analyzing geographic data, I am proficient in handling geographic information and supplementing my analysis with programming-based data wrangling methods.

For more information on the projects I worked on in this six-week summer source, click the "GIS Work" tab above or click [here](https://xochitlmedina.github.io/xochitlmedina/geog13.html)
